Description
===========

QuickShare (qs) is a variant of the (now legacy) SimpleHTTPServer present in
python 2.x. It allows one to share quickly directories by opening a http
server. qs supports both python2 and python3.

You can define an upload rate limit to prevent the clients from using all
your bandwidth and it automatically searches a free port if the given or
default one is taken.

Why QuickShare?
===============

Sharing is fun, but it quickly becomes a pain when dealing with multiple
operating systems, platforms and unexperimented users. Nowadays, almost
everything has a web interface, why should'nt we use it?
